# Asynchronous Point Of Sale System

The program displays all the burger bars items and collect customer orders. 
This restaurants sells three types of items: Burgers, Sides and Drinks. Customer can purchase 
individual items or combos that are comprised of any burger, side and drink. All items that are apart
of a combo will be discounted by 15% (most expensive items are added to combos first).

<p style="font-weight: bolder">For example, if a customer were to order the following items:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">

    1. Python Burger $5.99
    2. C Burger $4.99 
    3. Medum Fires $3.49
    4. Small Fries $2.49 
    5. Large Coke $2.99 
</div>

Then the combo would include the Python Burger, Medium Fries and Large Coke because those are the most expensive items 
that can be used to create a combo.
